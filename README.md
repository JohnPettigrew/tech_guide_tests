This repo contains tests for the Parkinson's Uk Tech Guide website, following a behaviour-driven-development (BDD) approach and built on the TestEvolve platform. This provides an installable environment for creating, recording and running tests.

If you push to this repo, you must:

* use page objects to model the web page - don't put HTML logic into the test definitions; and
* EITHER create your step definitions using the TestEvolve recorder;
* OR use well-formed and readable Ruby to create your definitions.

The repo is owned by John Pettigrew, Senior Product Manager - Tech Guide. PRs will only be accepted from our team, but please do fork the repo if you find the approach useful for your own tests!
